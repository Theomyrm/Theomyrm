Hi, I'm T. or @Theomyrm, a biology student (almost graduated), with a huge crush on coding and maths, mathematical models, mathematical and complex simulations, gamedev, IoT, SBC 
like Rpi, Opi, quantum programing, and so. 

I love GNU/Linux, and have almost all of my devices with linux. I'm used to Fedora, bbuntu and debian. My favorite distro I think is fedora. I'm used to manage github on a regular 
basis, adding repos, viewing instructions, tutorials, etc.

I have some experience with:

C#: I know the basics, know how to declare variables, make functions, classes, but Unity oriented: not on other environment.

Python: This is the lenguage which I have more experience with. I have experience using qiskit for quantum computing, turtle for making graphics, matplotlib, numpy, etc.

R: I've used this lenguage multiple times for various bioinformatics exercises and works

Bash: My second best. I love to use it everyday.

Anything related to biological simulations, IoT for biological data extraction, biological mathematical modeling, it's in my interest and would like to contribute in any way I 
can.

In the future I'm looking to upload my personal projects projects.
