Hi, I'm T. or @Theomyrm, a biology student (almost graduated), with a huge crush on coding and maths, mathematical models, mathematical and complex simulations, gamedev, IoT, SBC 
like Rpi, Opi, quantum programing, and so. 

I love GNU/Linux, and have almost all of my devices with linux. I'm used to Fedora, ubuntu and debian. My favorite distro I think is fedora. I'm used to manage 
github on a regular basis, adding repos, viewing instructions, tutorials, etc.

I have some experience with:

C#: I know the basics, know how to declare variables, make functions, classes, but Unity oriented: not on other environment.

Python: This is the language which I have more experience with. I have experience using qiskit for quantum computing, turtle for making graphics, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, etc.

R: I use R almost all the time for work; as I work like some kind of junior data engineer on an environmental company.

Bash: My second fav. I love to use it everyday, it's so easy to use and understand and can make your computer unique.

Anything related to biological simulations, IoT for biological data extraction, biological mathematical modeling, it's in my interest and would like to contribute 
in any way I can.

I'm used to upload my works to github. Not all of them, as some of them are private, but I have some tutorials and little programs.
